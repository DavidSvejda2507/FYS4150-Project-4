# FYS4150-Project-4

Compile and run the test using
```bash
make test
```

## Problem 5:
```bash
make Problem5
```

## Problem 6:
```bash
make Problem6
```

## Problem 7:
```bash
make Problem7
```
This will run a test run with L=100 and n = 1e5 for up to 10 parallel processes
It took me about 1300 seconds or 20 min to run
